# Fitnessapp

## Requirements

- [Node.js][1]
- [Git Bash][2]
- Code editor (I use [VSCode][3])

## Installation

1. Navigate to a directory where you want the project folder
1. Open a CLI
    - Right click -> click "Git Bash Here".
    - You can also use Commando Prompt (TIP: type `cmd` in file line)
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/oska1204/Fitnessapp`
1. Navigate to folder `cd Fitnessapp`
1. Run `npm install`
1. Open project
    - If you have installed [VSCode][3] run `code .`
    - From your code editor

## Editing HTML

Edit the "head.html" and "body.html" files, in the same directory as "index.html".

And if you want to edit the base html, you can find it at "compile/html/base.html".

After you're done editing, run `npm run compile` in the command line.

You can see what the html is gonna look like in "output.html".

## Web Components

This project uses [WebKey][4] for web components.

I would recommend you read the [WebKey][4] README.md, to understand the code.
